# machineLearning
This is a basic level project that I built after learning about the basic models of machine learning. The said model is based on linear regression on a single independent variable which is provided in the dataset.
The dataset contains the past data i.e. salary that is to be provided to an employee based on the years of experience. We have applied a learning algorithm using Python in Jupyter Lab that predicts the salary according to the years of experience given as input.
